                Fortnite has always been one of my favorite games ever since it came out. I've been playing from Season 1, and some of my greatest memories gaming have been with friends on Fortnite.
                While the core gameplay is still great, it can become a little repetive at times after playing for almost 8 years. This lead me and my friends to try and create our own challenges to change up the gameplay loop. I got this idea from playing Strat Roulette on the old Call of Duty games with my scrims team.
                Over the years, we have accumulated some of our favorite strategies and rules. I believe the entire Fortnite community as a whole should have an easier, streamlined experience to enjoy these twists and experience the fun for themselves.
                There came <b>FortLotto</b>, an extension to Fortnite where anyone can enter their squad members, pick their skins, and jump right into the action. <b>FortLotto</b> will generate a unique arrangement for your squad, each member getting their own individual challenge. Whats even better, <b>FortLotto</b> will select the drop location for you as well.
                No setup, no creating of an account necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                Me and my squad have had some lengthy benders on this game, and it can be fun to keep track of your wins and losses on a given night, so I decided to add this as well.
                The wins in <b>FortLotto</b> are extremely rewarding, much more than a standard Victory Royale.
                What is more important though is losing. Even when you happen to lose, the game is fun and refreshing.
            </p>

            <p>
                I didn't want to implement this as it is totally up to the squad at hand, but feel free to set punishments if any squad member is to break their rule! We frequently do.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Thank you</b> for playing my passion project, and I hope you enjoy playing <b>FortLotto</b> as much as my squad does. I encourage you to share your best moments and victory royales with other users.
            </p>
